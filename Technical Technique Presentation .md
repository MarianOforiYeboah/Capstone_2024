# Technical Technique Presentation on Handling Nulls in Pandas

## Introduction
The presentation will cover the significance of data cleaning techniques, specifically handling null values in datasets using Pandas, a powerful Python data manipulation tool.
Null values are common in data sets and can significantly impact data analysis outcomes if improperly managed.
Effective handling of null values in ETL processes is crucial for maintaining data quality and integrity. These values can indicate errors in data collection or transfer, affecting data quality, consistency, business decisions, and integrity. Standardizing how nulls are handled ensures consistency across the ETL pipeline, prevents skews in results, and ensures accurate reporting and analysis.

## Objectives of the presentation
- To provide a comprehensive understanding of null value management in Pandas.
- To demonstrate effective techniques for handling nulls in Pandas.
- To provide insights into improving data integrity for ETL processes.

## Background
Prioritizing data quality is essential when performing ETL tasks. Incomplete datasets can cause data inconsistency, poor quality, and flawed business decisions. Identifying and addressing null values is critical for accurate reporting and analysis. Standardizing null value treatment across different systems maintains data consistency and integrity. This presentation will focus on null value treatment in Pandas, a crucial aspect of data preprocessing.

## Sample Data Selection
The data sample chosen for presentation is diverse, reflecting typical ETL scenarios and including null values.
The sample data for this presentation has been chosen based on the following criteria:
- Relevance to common ETL scenarios.
- Variety in data types and structures.
- Null values are present to demonstrate cleaning techniques.
## Source of data
- Best in Show (data about dogs)- Kaggle datasets from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/best-in-show-data-about-dogs].
- The Best in Show dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides comprehensive information about various dog breeds, their characteristics, their Genetic diseases, and Life spans. The original dataset set has 69 columns, but it has been narrowed down to 29 columns for this presentation. It has a lot of null values, which is perfect for this presentation illustration.
