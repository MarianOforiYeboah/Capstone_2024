<br>

Null values typically indicate missing or unknown data. They can occur during data collection, transfer, or due to transformations applied to the data. It’s essential to handle nulls appropriately during data analysis to avoid errors or misleading results

## 🐼 Detection of Null Values
To work with null values, you must first identify them. Pandas offers two functions for this purpose:

🐾  isnull(): This function returns a DataFrame or Series that indicates whether each value is null

🐾  notnull(): This function is the opposite of isnull(). It returns True for non-null values
<br><br>
<h3><img src="Img/clipboard.png" width="40" >  Here is an example of using `isnull()` to detect nulls</h3>
<br> You can edit based on your data frame to match. 

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'categories': [1, 2, None, 4]})

# Detecting nulls
nulls = df.isnull()
print(nulls)
```

## 🐼 Ways of handling nulls in pandas
Dealing with null values is a frequent task when working with data in Pandas. Various methods can be used to handle nulls, including dropping them, replacing null values, and interpolating. In this context, we'll discuss two  ways to handle nulls: dropping and replacing.

The video below walks you through a step-by-step procedure on handling nulls in these 2 different ways using pandas
